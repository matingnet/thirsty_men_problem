Steps for Solving the Thirsty Men Problem:

1. Shuffling the Cups:
   - The guests will rearrange their cups such that no one holds their own cup.
   - To achieve this, they can stand in a circle and pass their cup to the person on their right. 
   - This ensures that each guest ends up holding a cup that doesn't belong to them.

2. Secure Placement Using Encryption:
   - Each guest, say Guest X, will create a secret key that is known only to them and the pourer. 
   - Guest X will then:
     - Ask the owner of the cup they are holding to choose a large random number.
     - Encrypt this number using their secret key.
     - Perform a modulus operation (`mod N`) on the encrypted result to ensure the number falls within the range of available positions (0 to N-1).
     - Place the cup they are holding in the position corresponding to the result of the modulus operation.

3. Validation by the Pourer:
   - The pourer, who knows Guest X's secret key, can independently verify that the calculation was done correctly.
   - This ensures that Guest X didn’t intentionally place the cup in an incorrect position.

4. Repeat for All Guests:
   - This process is repeated for every guest until all cups are placed in the positions determined by the secure computation.

The following question may arise:  
Why is it necessary to shuffle the cups in the first place?  

Answer:  
Shuffling the cups ensures fairness and enforces cooperation. Here's why:  

1. Incentive to Follow the Rules:  
   - When the cups are shuffled, no guest holds their own cup.  
   - If a guest disobeys the rules, the guest holding their cup will retaliate by refusing to place it on the table.  
   - As a result, the disobedient guest will have no chance to drink, creating a strong incentive for everyone to follow the rules.  

2. Fair Distribution of Responsibilities:
   - Without shuffling, some players (e.g., those assigned the middle positions) might refuse to place their own cups because they perceive it as a disadvantage.  
   - In the shuffled setup, it is not the cup owner but the person holding the cup who is responsible for placing it, ensuring a fair distribution of responsibilities.

Simulation of the process with three players  

Players and Initial Setup:  
1. Players:  
   - Player A, Player B, Player C.  

2. Cups:  
   - Each player initially holds their own cup:  
     - Player A holds Cup A.  
     - Player B holds Cup B.  
     - Player C holds Cup C.  

3. Shuffling:  
   The cups are shuffled so no player holds their own cup:  
   - Player A holds Cup B.  
   - Player B holds Cup C.  
   - Player C holds Cup A.  

Simulation Steps:  

Step 1: Player A’s Turn  
- Player A creates a secret key.  
- Player A asks the owner of Cup B (Player B) to choose a random number (e.g., 15).  
- Player A encrypts the number and calculates the position by performing modulus 3 on the result.  
- Result: Player A places Cup B in Position 2.  

Step 2: Player B’s Turn  
- Player B creates a secret key.  
- Player B asks the owner of Cup C (Player C) to choose a random number (e.g., 9).  
- Player B encrypts the number and calculates the position by performing modulus 3 on the result.  
- Result: Player B places Cup C in Position 0.  

Step 3: Player C’s Turn  
- At this point, only Position 1 is left.  
- Player C places Cup A directly in the remaining position (Position 1).  

Final Outcome:  
The cups are placed as follows:  
- Position 0: Cup C  
- Position 1: Cup A  
- Position 2: Cup B  

This ensures fairness and adherence to the rules. Each player cooperates because no one holds their own cup, and disobedience results in not being able to drink.
